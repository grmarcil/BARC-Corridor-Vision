# Berkeley Corridor Dataset
This dataset was collected from the front camera of a BARC robot
(barc-project.com) in the hallways of Etcheverry Hall, Berkeley, CA.

## Subfolders

### Originals
The original, lens-corrected images gathered from the robot camera. The lens
calibration is imperfect, as there is some curvature and dark fisheye corners
leftover. Collection for a future dataset could be improved with better camera
placement (higher mounting point), a longer-distance lens (maybe two to
compensate for the diminished angle), and a longer calibration collection
process (used ROS camera_calibration package but did not get full green bars in
every category).

### XML
The XML output from MIT CSAIL LabelMe tool. Labels were hand applied by Bike
Zhang and Greg Marcil. Labels were applied as polygons marking the open floor
regions.

### Labels
The images in this folder were generated from the contents of /xml by
render_labels.py. Pixels corresponding to floor are marked 1, all other pixels
are 0. These images are used as labels for training the neural network.

### BW_Labels
Also generated by render_labels.py, these images are for human visualization,
marking the floor with 255 and everything else with 0.

### Overlaid_Labels
Also generated from render_labels.py for human visualization, these images are
the original images overlaid with a translucent green mask where the floor was
marked.
